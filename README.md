# Hi there! 👋 I'm @RandomBagger

### 👀 About Me
I'm passionate about **Psychology**, **Computers**, and anything that gets the adrenaline pumping. Always curious and learning new things that excite the mind and spirit.

I see **pornography as a form of art** — a medium that expresses raw human emotions, desires, and connections. In that sense, I consider myself an **artist**, exploring and creating in a space where boundaries are pushed and new forms of expression are discovered.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
I'm diving deep into research on the **effects of pornographic content on human psychology** — uncovering how it shapes thoughts, behaviors, and the human experience.

### 💞️ Let's Collaborate
I'm open to collaborating on **erotic** and **ambitious** projects. If it's bold and breaks boundaries, I'm in.
